Xiaomi Firmware Updater is a project that started in January 2018, which aims to provide firmware packages for all Snapdragon Xiaomi devices, in order to allow custom ROM users to update their devicesâ€™ firmware easily through custom recovery instead of having to flash full ROM every time they want to update.

Using various Python and shell scripts, an automated process runs on Linux server every six hours, and extracts firmware from MIUI official ROMs, both Global and China, and uploads it to multi servers.

The project is founded and leaded by [yshalsager](https://github.com/yshalsager).

Xiaomi Firmware Updater is an open-source project, we welcome any contributions. You can head to the sources at [GitHub](https://github.com/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater).

Also, do mind that this project requires a lot of efforts, sleepless nights and strenuous perseverance. XiaomiFirmwareUpdater scripts are automated, running on a Linux server. If you appreciate these projects, please consider to donate via [Paypal](http://paypal.me/yshalsager)
